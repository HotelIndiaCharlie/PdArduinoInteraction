Arduino Interaction with Pd for Live Performance
------------------------------------------------

My Pd patch for performing live, using Pd as sample and MIDI recorder
and looper. A lot of the stuff can be triggered by external buttons
and a force sensitive resistor.

On the Pd side you will need:
- Some of my abstractions from 
  https://github.com/residuum/Puredata-abstractions
- Some libraries: comport, list-abs

I will post pictures, demos and stuff on http://ix.residuum.org/

For now, you can see part of the setup on 
http://www.residuum.org/pic.html

The circuit diagram is made with gSchem from gEDA 
(http://geda-project.org/).
